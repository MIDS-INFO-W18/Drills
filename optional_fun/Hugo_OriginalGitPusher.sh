#!/bin/bash 

# This is a bash script that automatically pulls and pushes to a remote repo every 10 minutes
# until 8 PM. It touches two files, and overwrites one with the current weather and appends
# the current weather to the other one.
#
# It requires a personal API token -- see https://github.com/blog/1509-personal-api-tokens
#
# To update a file with the weather as below, you need the weather utility
# (sudo apt-get install weather-util).
#
# Save this file in ~/bin, not in the same repository that you will be pulling/pushing from
# or gitignore it, otherwise the API info will be shared.

pass=1  # Set the loop counter to 1. This ensures that the first commit is commit 1.

while [ $(date "+%H") -lt 23 ] # The while condition is that the time on the 24 hour clock is less than 11 PM.
